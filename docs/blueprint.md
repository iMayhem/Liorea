## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted teal (#46878C) to invoke feelings of focus, knowledge and concentration.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated teal (#F0F8F8). This background matches the hue of the primary color, and evokes a clean feeling of efficient study.
- Accent color: A dark, saturated blue-purple (#312669). As an analogous color, it still blends well, but calls extra attention to important items.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, providing a modern and readable experience.
- Use simple, clear icons for task statuses (e.g., checkmarks, crosses) and subjects to enhance visual clarity.
- Design a clean, intuitive layout that allows easy navigation and quick task updates.
